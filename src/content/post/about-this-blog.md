## About This Blog: Stars and Scars

Welcome to my blog!  My name is Paul Philp, I've been a coder, manager, exectuve and founder.  I've won an Oscar (a group oscar) and I've gone bankrupt.  My last startup was a Customer Success application that went bankrupt after 9 years and 125 customers.  After the business failed I went through a major depression (which has lifted, thankfully).  After dusting myself off, I decided to learn modern web development. I've spent the past year hands-on learning **Typescript**, **Effect**, **React** / **Next**, **XState**, **Tailwind**, and **Astro** (for this blog).  I already knew **Javascript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **GraphQL**, **BigQuery**, **REST** and the **Google Cloud Platform**.  I'm feeling confident as a 'modern developer' now and it's time get back out there in the world to share my knowledge, adventures and lessons learned.

## Why the name is 'I Swear It Happened Just Like This'

I am a Canadian boomer.  My generation grew up with the music of [Joni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joni_Mitchell), [Lenny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Cohen), and [Neil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Young) in our DNA. 
The title is an ear worm lyric from the [Leonard Cohen song 'Closing Time'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-0lV5qs1Qw) that's been stuckin my head for years.  Here's why it's important to me: 

### Historical Patterns

One of the most important concepts in Software is the Pattern.  There are patterns that can only be seen over 1 - 2 decades and this is when I can contribute.  The 'reactive programming' technology paradign shift is the 7th or 8th I've tackled, and the AI bubble is the 3rd or 4th bubbleI've seen start to finish.  There are patterns to all of this apparent madness and I've had to opportunity to observe and learn so of them.  

We are nearing the end of one paradigm shift (**reactive programming**) and the beginning of another one that is emerging today.  We'll be exploring and navigating what will happen (and why?) as it evolves.

### The Inspiration of Leonard Cohen

When Leonard Cohen was my age (65) his business manager stole his entirewealth and he went bankrupt.  He dusted himself off and started recording the best music of his life.  He put on his fedora and toured the world multiple times. In Toronto, he gave a Springsteen-esque performance of 3.5 hours when he was in his mid-80's.

The best of Leonard Cohen happened after his 65th and his bankruptcy.  I plan on the same.  Please join me.
