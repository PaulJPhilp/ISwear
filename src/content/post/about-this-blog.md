## About This Blog: Stars and Scars

Welcome to my blog! My name is Paul Philp, and I've worn many hats in my career: coder, manager, executive, and founder. My journey has had its highs and lows‚Äîfrom winning a technical Oscar to experiencing bankruptcy. My last venture was a Customer Success application that served 125 customers over 9 years before closing its doors. The business failure led me into a major depression (which has thankfully lifted üôè). After regrouping, I decided to teach myself in modern web development. Over the past year, I've mastered **Typescript**, **Effect**, **React**/**Next**, **XState**, **Tailwind**, and **Astro** (which powers this blog). This complements my existing expertise in **Javascript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **GraphQL**, **BigQuery**, **REST**, and the **Google Cloud Platform**. Now, feeling confident as a 'modern developer', I'm ready to share my knowledge, adventures, and lessons learned.

## Why the Name 'I Swear It Happened Just Like This'

As a Canadian boomer, my generation was shaped by the music of [Joni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joni_Mitchell), [Leonard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Cohen), and [Neil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Young). The title comes from an earworm lyric in [Leonard Cohen's 'Closing Time'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-0lV5qs1Qw) that has resonated with me for years. Here's why it matters:

### Historical Patterns

One of the most fundamental concepts in software development is the Pattern. Some patterns only become visible over decades‚Äîthis is where my experience comes in. I've navigated through 7 or 8 technology paradigm shifts, and witnessed 3 or 4 AI bubbles from start to finish. There are patterns to this apparent chaos, and I've had the opportunity to observe and understand many of them.

We're currently witnessing the sunset of one paradigm (**reactive programming**) and the dawn of another (**undefined paradigm**). Through this blog, we'll explore and navigate what's coming next, and more importantly, understand why.

### The Inspiration of Leonard Cohen

When Leonard Cohen was my age (65), his business manager stole his entire wealth. He went bankrupt, dusted himself off, and began recording some of the best music of his life. He put on his fedora and toured the world multiple times. I saw him perform in Toronto, where he gave a Springsteen-esque performance lasting 3.5 hours‚Äîin his mid-80s.

The best of Leonard Cohen happened after 65 and bankruptcy. I plan to follow his example. Please join me.
