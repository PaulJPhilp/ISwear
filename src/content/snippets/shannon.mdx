## Shannon's Law
Shannon's Law is named after *Claude Shannon*, a mathematician and physicist who made significant contributions to the field of information theory. It is a fundamental law in the field of *communication* theory*, which deals with the transmission of information over a communication channel.

### Key Points

It sets the theoretical upper limit for **error-free data transmission**.
Capacity increases linearly with bandwidth but only logarithmically with signal-to-noise ratio.
It doesn't tell you how to achieve this capacity, only that it exists.
This law is **fundamental to modern telecommunications** and has influenced the development of everything from mobile phones to Wi-Fi networks. It helps engineers understand the theoretical limits of communication systems and guides the design of communication protocols and error correction methods.
