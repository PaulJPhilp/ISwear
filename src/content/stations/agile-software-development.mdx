## Transforming Software Development Philosophy

Agile Software Development, born from the 2001 Agile Manifesto, revolutionized how software is created by prioritizing flexibility and customer collaboration.

### The Core Values

The Agile Manifesto emphasizes:
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

### 12 Guiding Principles

1. Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery
2. Welcoming changing requirements
3. Frequent delivery of working software
4. Close, daily cooperation between business and developers
5. Building projects around motivated individuals
6. Face-to-face conversation as the most efficient communication
7. Working software as the primary measure of progress
8. Sustainable development pace
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence
10. Simplicityâ€”maximizing work not done
11. Self-organizing teams
12. Regular reflection and adaptation
