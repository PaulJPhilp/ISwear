## The Evolutionary Path of Technological Innovation

The Law of Increasing Modularity, developed by Clayton Christensen, explains how complex technologies become more standardized and modular over time.

### The Core Concept

As technologies mature, they progress through a predictable pattern:
- Initially: Integrated, complex, and performance-driven
- Over time: Become more standardized, modular, and customizable

Key characteristics of this progression:
- Early innovations require tight integration for performance
- As technologies improve, components become more interchangeable
- Modularization enables faster innovation and lower costs
- Allows new entrants to compete by mixing and matching components

### Technological Evolution

The law demonstrates how:
- Complex systems become simpler
- Performance shifts from hardware to software
- Customization becomes easier and more affordable
- Innovation moves to new, less-established domains

### Impact

Christensen's Law reveals:
- The natural lifecycle of technological development
- Why integrated systems give way to modular architectures
- How disruptive innovations emerge
- The importance of adaptability in technological ecosystems

A fundamental principle explaining the dynamic nature of technological progress and innovation.
