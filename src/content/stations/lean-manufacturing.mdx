## The Art of Waste Elimination

Lean Manufacturing, originating from Toyota's production system, is a systematic approach to minimizing waste while maximizing productivity.

### The Core Principles

Lean Manufacturing focuses on five key principles:
1. **Value**: Understand what creates value from the customer's perspective
2. **Value Stream**: Map out all steps in the production process
3. **Flow**: Ensure smooth, uninterrupted production
4. **Pull**: Produce only what is needed, when it is needed
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Constantly seek ways to reduce waste

### Key Concepts

- **Muda (Waste)**: Identifying and eliminating non-value-adding activities
- **Kaizen**: Continuous incremental improvement
- **Just-in-Time (JIT)** production
- **Jidoka**: Building quality into the process

### Impact

Lean Manufacturing revolutionized industrial production by:
- Reducing operational costs
- Improving product quality
- Increasing efficiency
- Minimizing inventory
- Enhancing customer satisfaction

A philosophy that transformed manufacturing and influenced management practices across industries.
