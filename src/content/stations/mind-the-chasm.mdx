## The Technology Adoption Lifecycle

Crossing the Chasm, developed by Geoffrey Moore, explains the critical challenge of marketing high-tech products from early adoption to mainstream success.

### The Technology Adoption Curve

Moore identified five distinct customer segments:
1. **Innovators**: Technology enthusiasts, first to adopt
2. **Early Adopters**: Visionaries seeking breakthrough advantages
3. **Early Majority**: Pragmatists wanting proven technology
4. **Late Majority**: Skeptical, cost-conscious consumers
5. **Laggards**: Traditionalists, last to adopt

### The Chasm

The critical gap between early adopters and the early majority represents a significant marketing challenge:
- Early adopters embrace new technology for its potential
- Early majority requires practical, reliable solutions
- Bridging this gap requires fundamentally different marketing strategies

### Crossing Strategies

Key approaches to cross the chasm:
- Target a specific, well-defined market segment
- Provide a whole product solution
- Create a "beachhead" market
- Focus on solving critical, specific problems
- Build credibility through reference customers

### Impact

Moore's concept revolutionized:
- Technology marketing
- Product development strategies
- Understanding of innovation diffusion
- Startup and technology company growth approaches

A seminal work that explains why most innovative technologies fail to achieve widespread adoption.
