## Organizational Structure and Software Design

Conway's Law, proposed by Melvin Conway in 1967, reveals the profound relationship between an organization's communication structure and the software it produces.

### The Law

Conway's Law states that organizations design systems that mirror their own communication structures. In other words, the architecture of a software system reflects the social boundaries of the organization that created it.

Key observations:
- Software design is deeply influenced by team communication
- Organizational silos manifest in software architecture
- Communication patterns shape technical design
- Interdepartmental boundaries become system boundaries

### Impact

This law provides critical insights into:
- Software design and organizational dynamics
- The importance of communication in technical teams
- Why redesigning software often requires restructuring teams
- Understanding the social aspects of software development

Conway's Law has become a fundamental principle in understanding the intricate relationship between organizational structure and technological innovation.
